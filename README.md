EODHD APIs introduced a new product called “Indices Historical Constituents Data”. This API provides two key functions: one for listing indices and another for retrieving the constituents of each index. 
Python Django is a high-level framework and can act as RESTFul API endpoint to receive and show JSON data from EODHD APIs.
